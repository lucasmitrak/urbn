scraper scripts need to:
	check for last position in scrape (if failed, start where you left off)
	if scrape is new then check if tables are full and if yesman tables are full
		if full and full
			call yesman to clear yesman tables, if yesman isnt already trying
		if full and empty
			copy tables to yesman tables
			truncate tables
			start scrape
		if empty and full
			call yesman to clear yesman tables, if yesman isnt already trying
			start scrape
		if empty and empty
			start scrape

MAYBE: yesman needs to start scrapes if the yesman tables are empty, or empty for some time period
