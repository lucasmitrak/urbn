spoderman homepage:
	needs to be like virtualizor controlpanel
	however instead of showing computer system data and controls, it should show the status of the data
	Example:
		Counts
		datetime of last record scraped
		datetime of last record added to to unified tables
		datetime of last wiki page added
		support details and/or links
		logos of URBN and Client (this is not a cheap product, lets treat them like rich cunts)
		controls like contact form
		chat link (to kayoko support and ticket system)
		a place to post flash news (link a single highlighted text line that declares scheduled maintance, or invoice outstanding)
		crime map of their area over the last week
		some animated graphs or charts or streaming posts like on chenope

spoderman wiki:
	we can make a better wiki than tiki for this project
	until then send the user to the tiki url
	
	the wiki needs version tracking (like git)
	the ability to see past versions
	the ability to allow users with permission to edit
	searchability
	catagorization
	map and image support
	ability to upload a file then link it to multiple pages
	ability to link pages, (easily for users)
	
spoderman search:
	we need a google looking/style search
	like pirate bay, we will have the catagories to search (entry points into the unified tables: people, locations, images, groups, tags)
	the default will be all entry points
	
	we need advanced features for each entry point (make these features accross all entry points so as to be simple for the tards)
	advanced features are link that of google
	Example:
		Im looking for a place to eat on google:
		I type food, google guesses im hungry and shows me resturants and grocery stores.
		Googles algo requires mass users to be accurate, which we will never have

		on spoderman, i want to search a name:
		i type joe swanson, spoderman looks for that string in people, locations, groups, and tags.
		however i could specify to look only for a person, or a place, or a group
		i could specify an address with a radius or city or county, spoderman would search people, locations, groups, and tags but only return results where the location is unknown or the location matches my location parameters.
		i could specify a date range and only records of unknown date and those in my range will be returned
		i could specify to only return results that strictly fit my parameters, (only return results in my date/location range and dont include the results with unknown dates/locations)

spoderman email notifications:
	we need to allow the user to push notifications to their email or phone (i know how to add text support)
	they also need to be able to silence notifications during the night or such and pick if only severe notices are pushed to email or text
	any combo of these notification settings

spoderman image/file gallery:
	this is why everyone loves the tiki, also the file gallery.
	if we add this then we can drop the tiki even sooner

	all images and files need permissions, whitelist style, either by user or group

spoderman image search:
	the user uploads a minimum of 3 images and the searcher notifies them of matches
	they should be able to load as many images as they want in each single set

spoderman groups:
	we need to have users in groups like on the tiki

spoderman billing:
	we will need to port the system to the billing system:
	this is easy, we will be linking virtualizor-spoderman-billing-kayoko so as to enforce prompt payment
	merek will handle this completely

spoderman tagging:
	all results and pages in the wiki and files and images need to be able to be tagged

spoderman media:
	they need to be able to view videos on spoderman, easy
	if this sucks terribly then we can force the download of the media to the clients machine and they can watch it locally
